# bloom_bridge_app
we prototyped a backend proof-of-concept in a form of open-source QGIS plugin: the plugin retrieves EMIT L2A RFL granules from NASA LP DAAC (Harmony API was used to recieve granules) and converts them into analytical layers with spectral index calculations used for bloom detection algorithms. Also User App UI main interface mockups created.
